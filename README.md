# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> Your answer here...

We would need some kind of software that connects all of the bank accounts and credit cards.
We would also need a calculator function to handle the math and also to round up, so we can
get the correct amount of change to save.

- Would you have to learn a new technology?


> Your answer here...

Yes I would need to learn a new technology something similar to a banking mobile app with different accounts all connected.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)




> Your answer here...
1.user should be able to login to all bank account and intergrated
2.user should be able to calculate and round up the the nearest dollar amount.
3.user should be able to save the difference and save the difference rounded up.


- What are the app milestones

> Your answer here...

have a great user experience

easy accesible interface

no bugs 

and everything works flawless.

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Your answer here...

the build time, trello card, and whos working on what tasks

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Your answer here...

i would say yes this is feasible for a hack athon

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Your answer here...
i dont think so allot of reaserch would have to be done with the bank intergration.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Your answer here...
if they use the app there would be incentives and promotions to lure consumers to downlaod my app

- How could people misuse this application?


> Your answer here...

People may possibly try to commit bank fraud with the app , but there has to be very tight security to prevent that from hapenning. So we would also need cyber security.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Your answer here...

data leaks, intrusions, hackers

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

we would need a profile page, and interest from each profile, matched with a dot.map to a matched profile.

> Your answer here...

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

no

> Your answer here...

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

1. user profile
2.interest
3.matched profiles
4.text instant message form
5. video stream

> Your answer here...

- What are the app milestones

> Your answer here...

Users should be able to be matched by similar interest

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> Your answer here...

gender, preference, and likes

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Your answer here...

yes it is

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Your answer here...
yes this app would be able to be built in no time
- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Your answer here...
people would love to interact with the app because everyone wants to talk to random people on social media and are looking for love.

- How could people misuse this application?

> Your answer here...

its anonymous, but there would have to moderators

- Are there any safety issues with this application?



> Your answer here...

consumers personal information getting accesed or ip address traced finding consumer address potential threat.
