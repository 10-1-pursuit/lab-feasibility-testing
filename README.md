# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> It will be used for IOS and Android platforms. 

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Yes,it will be integrating with payment APIs and bank systems would likely require learning new technologies related to financial transactions and security protocols.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)
User Stories for the Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
> As a user, I can register an account.
As a user, I can manually input my daily expenses and round up the change.
As a user, I can view my total savings.
As a user, I can log in and log out securely.

- What are the app milestones

> 1. User registration and authenciation system.
2. Develop the expense tracking feature.
3. Implement the round-up mechanism. 
4. Create a dashboard to display total savings.
5. Securely store user data on a backend server. 

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Data privacy and security  when dealing with financial data will affect the app. It will be user friendly interface for easy expense tracking.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes, it is feasible for a hack-a-thon with a group of developers and a focused approach on essential features.

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> The MVP focus on manual expense tacking and round up savings without complex on integrations with banks.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> The notifications will be rewards for consistent saving and constant reminders or notifications to input daily expenses.

- How could people misuse this application?

> Users might miuse the app by entering false expenses to mainpulate savings. Proper validaiton and monitoring are necessary to prevent misuse.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Ensuring secure data storage and tranmission is crucial to protect user financial information. Strong user authenciation and authorization mechanisms are essential to safeguard user accounts.

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).
