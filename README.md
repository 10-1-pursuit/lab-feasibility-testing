# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> Your answer here...
I would need front-end and back-end implementation.

For the front-end, I would mainly need: 
    UI framework that is most compatible with the programming language that would be easy on both Users and Devs. 

For the back-end, I would mainly need: 
    A server to see the implementation real-time, a database to store any collected data from users or Devs and an API that can handle user authentification, secure transactions and interactions between financial services. If this cannot be done in one API, I would need multiple 

I would also need tech that allows for mobile development features and usability

I would need airtight or as close as possible, security features.

I would also need to make sure my app is compliant with financial regulations and other security standards

Analytic tools that monitor user behavior and app performance 

Customer support would be necessary as well 

I would also need proper documentation for users and devs alike 

A lawyer would be a necessary investment 

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Your answer here...

I would have to learn the ins and outs of security regulations or any tech that would lessen the work for me 

I would potentially need to learn about Cloud Hosting to store data 

I would need encryption to protect and secure user data 

Hopefully, I wouldn't need to learn a new programming language

Seriously, a great lawyer that can offer the best protection in any use case

I might need a platform for document management or even creation 



- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> Your answer here...
As a new user, I would want to be able to sign up securely with my email and password. 
As a registered user, I would want secure sign in and notification features that show this.

As a user, I would want a secure connection to the account my funds are coming from

As a user, I would want secure monitoring of my transactions, automated or manual roundup of spare change and more notifications.

As a user, I would want to set up the amount to save/round up inside of a savings account

As a user, I would want to track the process of how much I've saved 

As a user, I would also want to see how, if possible, I could save more. 

As a user, I would want to withdraw the funds I've saved into my bank account or even a new account

As a user, I would want an easily navigatable site AND profile.
I would want to CRUD my profile and any features I have access to.

As a user, I would like to see the app's security measures, legal statements, how my data is used and opt out of any optional communications

As a user, I would want access to timely and adequate customer support
- What are the app milestones

> Your answer here...

I would then create a time-line of the goals I would like to set 

I would then go down the list, step by step: 

 -if i have a team, I would need to ensure that we are all on the same page in terms of goals, schedules and a solid if not flexible plan. I would want very little room for discrepencies and allocate time for check-ins

I would need to do adequate research to ensure I can understand the task and how best to implement the plan

A framework would need to be created with as clear an outline as possible

I would set up a goal planning checklist 

I would need feasibility testing 

Learn how to use the tech sufficiently 

Build and test a basic app 

Build user interactions 

Update user interaction for best functionality 

Recheck task requirements

Make it look great 

Handle any questons, comments, concerns, bugs, etc

Final reviews 

Submission


- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Your answer here...
I would need to consider any admin management functionalities 
Any cost management and monetization
Possibly a feedback from clients and potential releases of updates and/or new features
Any accessibility features 
Compatiblity across platforms, devices, etc

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Your answer here...
   Yeaaaaaahhhh 

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Your answer here...
Can I? At this moment , not a thought I'm willing to dwell on. 

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Your answer here...
I would encourage users to test out the app for 14 days and if it has helped them save a certain amount, I would give them bonus savings. Nothing outrageous, my pockets cannot handle that. 
Even daily or milestone rewards 
I would give personalized recommendations (BIG $$) on how to save more or better

Challenges
Reminders
Referrals 
Gamification 
Feedback options 


- How could people misuse this application?

> Your answer here...
People could use unauthorized bank accounts and commit fraud
Money laundering apparently 
Data breaches from hackers
Scammers can create a fake app in attempt to be us
Spam attacks as well 

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Your answer here...
Yes, and to combat those issues - as stated above- I would potentially:

have very strict user authentification which includes monitoring access, unusual activity and thus flagging said activity

AML & KYC features 

Strong data encryption 

Educating users on their safety and use of the app 

Fraud detection algos

Follow strict data protection guidelines 

User blocking features

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).
