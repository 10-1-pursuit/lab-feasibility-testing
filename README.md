# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> **Mobile App Development:** Android or iOS 💁‍♂️
> **Real-time Chat:** Tech like Firebase for real-time messaging ⏳ ✉️
> **User Rating System:** A database to store user ratings and feedback

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Yes, I'll have to learn how to implement real-time chat functionality since I'm not familiar with it 😅

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> **As a user, I can :**
✨ Select a topic & mood
✨ Be matched with another user
✨ Have a text chat with the matched user
✨ Rate the discussion after it ends. 

- What are the app milestones

>✨ Create a basic app interface with topic & mood selection. 😌
>✨ Implement real-time chat functionality. 🗣️
>✨ Add rating & feedback system. 🗣️
>✨ Ensure anonymity and user security 🥸 🛡️

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

>✨ Privacy measures to protect user identities. 🛡️
>✨ Server scalability to handle large number of chats 🗣️ 🗣️ 🗣️ 

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes, especially if I focus on text-based chat & basic rating features. 💁‍♂️

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> I can start with text chat only and then consider adding voice chat as a reach goal **IF** time allows 🫡

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Perhaps implement a reward system for active users such as: 
**🪙 Vitural Currency 🪙:** Users can earn by being active on the app. They can then use the currency to buy virtual items like custom avatars or backgrounds.
**✨ Unlockable Features ✨ :** Users who reach a certain level can unlock new chat topics or mood options.

- How could people misuse this application?

> Users might engage in inappropriate discussions. 🙊

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Ensure anonymity & privacy protection measures to prevent users from sharing personal information. 

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> There would need to be a combination of front-end & back-end technologies such as:
**Mobile App Development** & **Real-time Chat**.

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Since I'm not familiar with these technologies then yes I would need to learn them.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> **As a user, I can :**
✨ Log in & create an account.
✨ Be matched with another user based on my preferences.
✨ Have a text chat with the matched user
✨ Rate the discussion after it ends.  

- What are the app milestones

>**1** Create a basic app interface with topic & mood selection. 😌
>**2** Implement real-time chat functionality. 🗣️
>**3** Add rating & feedback system. 🗣️
>**4** Ensure anonymity and user security 🥸 🛡️

- What other things need to be considered about this app

>**1** Implement a reporting system to address inappropriate or abusive behavior within the app. 
 **2** Consider the long-term storage of chat histories, user profiles, and ratings.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes its feasible if  I focus on text-based chat & basic matching features for the MVP. ✨

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Start with text-based chat only and consider adding voice chat or other enhancements as future features. Keep the MVP simple and functional. 🫡

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Notify users of new chat opportunities or matches. ✌🏽

- How could people misuse this application?

> Misuse might include engaging in inappropriate discussions, harassment, or spamming. 😵

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Ensuring user safety is of paramount importance. It's essential to maintain user anonymity, prevent the sharing of personal information, and automatically erase chat histories at the conclusion of each session to safeguard user privacy. 🫡🛡️
