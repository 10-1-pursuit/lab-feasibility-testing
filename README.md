# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> I would use the technology im use to know so Js/JSX React and maybe Bootstrap for UX design. I would reference the calculator work we did. A phone app would work best since guest would use it on the move but for now desktop whould be ok.

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Eventually, to work with credit and bank cards. I think for the MVP users would put their recipits into the phone/desktop. Maybe save them as a picture? (* and it pulls the total? but that's for later development)

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> A <USER> can enter a reciept total and have it round up to leave a flat number (ie; 3.01 === 3.50 || 4.00). 
> A <USER> can set a min/max amout to round up for the purchase. (ie; 3.01 === 3.50 || 4.00). *Round to the nearst .50 or 1.00

> A <USER> can see the amount added to the purchase price.
> A <USER> can see the amount saved over all.
> A <USER> can adjust where the user puts the savings (ie applePay, savings, another credit card)

- What are the app milestones

> Day 1: Trello, wire framing, setting up GitHub, brain storming and maybe breaking up known components into groups. Asking clarifying questions

> Day 2: I'd probably start the code base today. Day 3 get someone to help me with the UX design because thats the most impressive part for non-coders.

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Do we need a database of past reciepts and what money went where

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes! I think so now! Setting up the MVP as little more than a calculator and a saved database .json would have the MVP requirments and lend for easy layout design.


- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Yes, speaking as I mentioned - it seems feasible but would mostly behave as a calculator with out the imagery functionality of pulling numbers from photos of recipts and connecting with banks

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> alerts that send (Look how much you've saved!) or features that allow you to review your past purchase (working along side a salesbot) 

- How could people misuse this application?

> It's connection with the banks is a major concern.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> It's connection with the banks is a major concern.

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

  Research neeeded for other backend services and libarays; CometChat Widget and Firebase backend service is where i would start.

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Oh yes. Several. 

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> A <newUser> could create a simple non-descriptive profile. Maybe saving some fave topics of conversation and mood emojies/type

- What are the app milestones

> Full discusion of what technology is needed and how small our initial chat group would be.
> Breaking up into teams to research, wirefram, gitHub and Trello.
> What components are needed and how we should divide the work flow

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> this seems HEAVY for a hackathon their seem to be alot of technology to get up to speed on.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Perhaps, a randomized chat genertor?  The services ive found breifly (cometChat) does require payment.


- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Your answer here...

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> If the <USER> had a favorited list of conversation topics or moods we could call their attention if someone else is looking for that topic or listed mood.

- How could people misuse this application?

> we would need a chatbot of some sort to listen to the conversation. could easily get offensive. 

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Harassment
