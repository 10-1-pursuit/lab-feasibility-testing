# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

>Javascript, Css, HTML

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> I would need an API that gets access to an users banks account.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> A form where users input their expenses or receipts and it calculates the change.

- What are the app milestones

> Creating functional UI, connecting the users bank account, and creating a function that calculates the change.

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Foreign bank accounts and getting access to them and fraudulent users.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Creating the functions to calculate the change is feasible but using a Bank API might take some time.

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Yes, if bank accounts aren't needed and the user manually adds the change to their own accounts.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> When they look at their savings after a month, they should be happier.

- How could people misuse this application?

> Users can steal personal info from other users and access their account information.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Fraud

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> JS, CSS, HTML

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Software/API that allows for communication.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> A page with a navigation bar for selecting category and mood with a text box in the middle for conversations.

- What are the app milestones

> 1. Creating a Nav Bar and Text box.
2. Learning new API for communication.
3. Making sure users can properly communicate with one another.
4. Securing user information.
5. Fixing bugs.


- What other things need to be considered about this app

> Making sure the conversations aren't offensive and to the topic.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> I would just include a text box without the voice chat.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Make sure the app feels fun and interactive. Have topics that encourage deep conversations.

- How could people misuse this application?

> People can enter the chats for innapropriate conversations.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> People leaking their information.
