# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> ** We would definitely need Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
> ** The app may benefit from using the Math Object in order to create a limited 'calculator' for rounding up the amount spent for every purchase.
> ** A database would be needed to store personal data including the accumulated amount of money saved.

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> ** It would be necessary to learn how to incorporate a database into an App.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> ** User will have to sign into their account.
> ** User will have to make a purchase.
> ** User will have to do calculations to round up the exact price to the next whole dollar amount of the purchase.
> ** User will have to calculate the difference between the exact amount and the number rounded up to.
> ** User will have to have to save the difference into what would be considered a "savings" account.
> ** User will have to be able to repeat this process accumulating savings with each purchase into this "account".  
> ** Team should be able to show that app can capture and save user data, allow users to add purchases and their prices for purchases, and then round those prices up to the nearest dollar.  Team should be able to show that the app can SAVE the purchase prices, the amount rounded up to, and the amount saved into a reliable database.  


- What are the app milestones

> Note: This is a 3-day project development starting on Friday and ending on Sunday 6pm. 
> Day 1 (Friday - approximately 2 hours):
   Set up Trello, asking clarifying questions about the project, accessing skills and capabilities of each team member, ensuring all team members are in contact with one another, reviewing project requirements, assigning tasks, wireframes, feasibility testing, planning schedules and meets, set-up Github repository and setting milestones for each team member and the team as a whole. 

> Day 2 (Saturday)
    
    > ** Team should attemp to find APIs which can serve the projects' purposes.
    > ** Learn how to use and sucessfully incorporate any APIs that have been found beneficial for the app demo.
    > ** Tasks that cannot be completed using reliable and available APIs should be tasked to team members who are best able to complete the task(s).
    > ** Team should be able to build at least a workable test prep or demo at this point. If not, it might be necessary to consider other app ideas.

> Day 3 (Sunday)
    > ** Build a basic app and deploy it.
    > ** Build out a static version of the features (placeholders and stubs).


- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> This app has future possiblities with banks and credit card companies to automatic the process of rounding cost of purchases to the nearest higher dollar and then putting the "change" in savings.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> I have not yet had any experience with hack-a-thons, so I cannot give a reasonable judgment to this question.  However, I believe that a team of extremely talented and/or experinced developers could have a decent prototype available in the alotted time. However, I would say that genreally, this is too short a time for this type of app even with four team members.

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Possibly, if there are API to use which could reduce the time it takes to develope databases, log-in accounts, etc.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Advertisement on social media sites.

- How could people misuse this application?

> As the app stands now, people need to manually add the purchase info and add the "change" that is saved after rounding up. If people are not honest about the amount purchased, the amount of change saved will be fraudulent.  

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Yes. Sign-in, ecurity issues, and data security issues.



## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> ** Again, basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS will be needed.
> ** Chat capabilities will be needed.

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> ** The technology for chat capability will be needed.
> ** Will the app need server bandwidth to support multiple converstations?

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> ** This app will need a chat/social media 
> ** The app should be anonymous (no pictures, real names, locations are shared).
> ** User will need a pseudo name to identify his/herself. 
> ** User will then need to select a topic of discussion.
> ** User will then select the current mood they are in (happy, sad, argumentative, etc.)
> ** User will then be randomly matched with another user for discussion based on matched topic of discussion and current mood.
> ** Either user can disconnect at any time.  
> ** Once a user has disconnected, the conservation is ended between the two users.

   
- What are the app milestones

> Note: This is a 3-day project development starting on Friday and ending on Sunday 6pm.

> Day 3 (Sunday)
    > ** Build a basic app and deploy it.
    > ** Build out a static version of the features (placeholders and stubs).

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> Users may want to save and use their criteria for later use.
> This app may require log-in capabilities and database storage at a later date.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> I'm not skilled or experienced enough to say one way or the other. However, I believe that that a basic demo is feasible for a hack-a-thon with teammates who are skilled and experienced enough to take on this challenge.  Note again, that I have not yet attended a hack-a-thon.

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> ** Eliminating the choice of topic and/or the mood may reduce the time creating a demo while keeping the basic structure of the app intact and understandable.


- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Through social media sites. People who comment on social media sites want to talk to other online and feel some type of connection.

- How could people misuse this application?

> It is very likely that the user "identity" could be hacked allowing hacker to use an identity without authorization to contact another user of the app.
> It is very likely that the user could use this anonymous identity to develop communications between vunerable individuals (children, mentally disburbed people, the elderly).

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> There are absolutely safety issues with this application.  Look to "How could people misuse this application?"  Before development of this app's demo, serious saftely precaustions need to be considered.  The fact that people can communicate between each other anonymously is a serious safety issue. How do we determine that one of the user is not a minor or disabled person unable to make reasonable deasons on their own?

Which Project is the Best Choice for this 2-Day Hackathon Project?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I would say that #2, "Random Chat App" would be the best option for a new demo project within the 3-day timeframe given, the resources and knowledge available, and the team as could be discerned that was given.  
    * Random Chat App is anonymous, so PII (Personal Identifiable Information) may not need to be required.
