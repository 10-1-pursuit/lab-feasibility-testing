# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> javascript , html , react and css 

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> no

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> the user will have a checkings and saving account 
the user will purchase products using checkings account 
the user will have remaining change on checking account from purchse that will then automatically transfer to savings account 
when inside saviings account user should have access ton change from previous purchase 

- What are the app milestones

>App planning  ,  Creating A REACT app , adding routing and links btw account pages , adding CRUD  to update the savings and checkings , to update savings on interaction instead of manually 

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> need access to the banks data 

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> yes 

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> manually adding the remaining balance in the app yourself and seperate pages

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> After every purchase notify them to add the savings .

- How could people misuse this application?

> not entering the accurate balance 

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> might not be any chnage remaining then ur not saving daily or no purchase made .

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> javascript , html , react and css 

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> no

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

>the user will have a login account to app
the user will have a drop down option of topics and categories to discuss 
the user will be placed in chat with someone that picked the same category or similar 
if no users in category have ai hold coversation

- What are the app milestones

> Plan app , access api , build skeleton on application chat page , complete funtionality usind CRUD , edit debug 

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> That someone may not pick the same category

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> no

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> maybe just a chat messenger without topic choice 

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> adding resonable topics

- How could people misuse this application?

> talking off a different topic then chosen 

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> no .. accesing data
