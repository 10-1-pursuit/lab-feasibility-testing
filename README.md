# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> Javascript, CSS, HTML, React

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Depending on future implementations Databases, payment gateways & certain APIs may be required.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> As a user, I can create an account and log in. 

> As a user, I can enter my daily purchase amounts.

> As a user, I can see my savings balance.

> As a user, I can set saving goals.

- What are the app milestones

> Day 1:
User registration and login system.

> Day 2:
Calculate and display savings balance.
Add savings goals functionality.

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Data security and privacy (handling financial data).

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Focus on manual transaction entry and basic savings tracking.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Offering rewards for reaching goals.

> Send notifications and reminders to enter daily transactions.

- How could people misuse this application?

> Users may artificially inflate their transactions to save more money.

> Spamming the system with fake transactions.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Ensure secure handling of user financial data.

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> Javascript, CSS, HTML, React

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Real-time chat or voice communication features may require learning new technologies.

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> As a user, I can log in anonymously.

> As a user, I can select a topic and mood for a conversation.

> As a user, I can chat with another person.

> As a user, I can rate the conversation.

- What are the app milestones

> Day 1:
User registration and anonymous login.
Topic and mood selection.
Basic chat functionality.

> Day 2:
Implement voice chat (if feasible).
Implement rating system.

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> Ensuring anonymity and privacy along with moderation for inappropriate content.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Yes

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Exclude voice chat if too complex.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Award points or badges for quality conversations and notify users of new matching opportunities.

- How could people misuse this application?

> Inappropriate content or harassment.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Ensure user data privacy and security.
