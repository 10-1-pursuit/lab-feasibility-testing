# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> Your answer here...
<!-- For a 2-day hackathon to create an app with Chime's Round Up functionality: -->

1. **Development Platform**: Choose a mobile app development platform (e.g., React Native, Flutter) for cross-platform compatibility.

2. **Backend**: Set up a basic server and database (e.g., Firebase) to handle transactions and savings data.

3. **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for secure transactions.

4. **Round-Up Logic**: Develop logic to calculate and transfer spare change.

5. **Security**: Implement user authentication and data security measures.

6. **UI/UX Design**: Create a simple, user-friendly interface.

7. **Notifications**: Add push notifications for user updates.

8. **APIs**: Connect with external financial services and institutions.

9. **Testing**: Test rigorously to ensure functionality.

10. **Documentation**: Create basic documentation for your app.

Remember to prioritize security and compliance, and be prepared for scaling and maintenance as needed.

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Your answer here...

3,4,5,7 from previous list

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> Your answer here... 

A user should be able to save the remaining balance from a transaction rounded to the nearest the closest dollar amount .

A user can set the amount they want to round per transaction 

- What are the app milestones

> Your answer here...
Plan w/ trello , exclalidraw , review requirements , meet w/ team , set up repo, learn how to use new technology ,build & deploy , intergrate user interaction (ui), TEST , TEST, TEST, & WHEN UR DONE , TEST AGAIN 

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> Your answer here...

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Your answer here... Sureeeeeeeee

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Your answer here... No, this the best I can do for now.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Your answer here... Referral program , ads

- How could people misuse this application?

> Your answer here...

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> Your answer here... Security measures to protect fraud .

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> Your answer here...
To create a networking app for topic-based random matching, you'll need:

1. **App Platform**: Choose a development platform (e.g., React Native, Flutter).

2. **Backend**: Develop a server (Node.js, Python) and database (MySQL, MongoDB).

3. **Authentication**: Implement user registration and login.

4. **Topic Selection**: Allow users to pick discussion topics.

5. **Matching**: Design an algorithm for topic-based matching.

6. **Messaging**: Integrate real-time chat using WebSockets or chat APIs.

7. **UI Design**: Create a user-friendly interface (UI/UX design).

8. **Notifications**: Include push notifications.

9. **Testing**: Ensure app functionality, privacy, and security.

10. **Hosting and Scaling**: Deploy on a cloud provider for scalability.

11. **Privacy and Security**: Implement data protection and comply with regulations.

12. **Monetization (Optional)**: Consider revenue models.

13. **Documentation**: Create user and developer guides.

14. **Legal Compliance**: Address legal and regulatory issues.

Focus on user privacy and scalability, and maintain the app for a positive user experience.
